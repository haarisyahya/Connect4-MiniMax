# Connect4-MiniMax
Connect4 with the Minimax algorithm! 

This repository includes the code to a fully functioning connect4 game that implements the minimax algorithm to simulate a PvE game. 
A heuristic is used to drive the algorithm to perform optimally. 
The user starts the game by dropping an 'X' into a column of their choosing, the AI responds and the game continues until there is a victor.
Try it for yourself!
